A few days back after my workout, I realise that my right knee cannot be straighten fully. When I do straighten it, the most right side of a particular muscle or tendon seems to hurt a lot and it feels like the muscle above my knee cap and below or under my quadriceps hurt a lot. It feels like it's swollen but I see no physical inflammation. It is particularly worst after I wake up. I have issues walking up and down the stairs sometimes after I seat too long.", "numReplies": 1, "replies": [{"author": "Arthritis expert", "created": "2018/01/15", "content": "It sounds like a bursitis around the knee, called pes anserine bursitis."}]}

I was put on metformin 2 X 500 twice a day but only took one pill with breakfast. My fasting glucose was still greater than 7. After three months on metformin my A1C was 7.3. Now I heard about Intermittent Fasting (IF) and have been trying 16/8 for the last four  weeks and have lost  4 lbs. I am a very active person at the gym. Work out 4-5 times a week cardio and strength training. Healthy dietary habits. Since IF I am no longer taking metformin and want to control my diabetes through diet and exercise. The only problem is although my fasting glucose is lower than when I was on metformin but it is still in 7-9 range. Is this normal when you are doing IF? During the day it gets normal. After meals its between 6-8.5. The high fasting glucose still concerns me but I really do not want to go on medicine and I do eat healthy and am determined to lose the extra 10 pounds I need to lose. I am 5\u2019 and weigh 135lbs and want to lose 10 pounds. Should I go back on metformin or continue doing what I am doing.
