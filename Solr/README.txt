# Apache Solr and Python #

Run the following command to install pysolr in your system

pip install pysolr

I use pysolr library to communicate with Apache Solr in Python
I created three functions: insert, search and delete
Insert: Insert data or a json file dataset (data should be in an array)
Search: Input is a query or Select ALL
Delete: Input is document's id or a query condition
